= Hazelcast Jet Reference Manual

Welcome to the Hazelcast Jet Reference Manual. This manual includes
concepts, instructions, and samples to guide you on how to use Hazelcast
Jet to build applications.

Hazelcast Jet is a distributed computing platform. It supports both
finite datasets (batch processing) and infinite streams with continuous
operators. With Hazelcast In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) providing storage
functionality, Hazelcast Jet performs data-local parallel execution,
enabling data-intensive applications to operate in real time. Using
directed acyclic graphs (DAG) to model relationships between individual
steps in the data processing pipeline, Hazelcast Jet is simple to deploy.
Hazelcast Jet is an Apache 2 licensed open source project. Please also
refer to the http://jet.hazelcast.org[Hazelcast Jet website] for
information on its features, use cases and performance considerations.

As the reader of this manual, you must be familiar with the Java
programming language and you should have installed your preferred
Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
