= Common Exceptions

You may see the following exceptions thrown when working with Jet:

* {jet-javadoc}/JetException.html[`JetException`]:
A general exception that will be thrown if a job failure occurs.
It will have the original exception in the cause field.
* {jet-javadoc}/core/TopologyChangedException.html[`TopologyChangedException`]:
This exception is thrown when a member participating in a job leaves the
cluster. The job will typically be restarted automatically without throwing
the exception to the user if auto-restart is enabled.
* {jet-javadoc}/core/JobNotFoundException.html[`JobNotFoundException`]:
Thrown when the coordinator node is not able to find the metadata for a
given job.

Furthermore, there are several Hazelcast exceptions that might be thrown
when interacting with `JetInstance`. For description of Hazelcast IMDG
exceptions, please refer to the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.9/manual/html-single/index.html#common-exception-types[IMDG Reference manual].
