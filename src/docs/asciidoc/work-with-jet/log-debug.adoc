= Monitor Execution and Diagnose Problems

== Configure Logging

Jet, like Hazelcast IMDG, does not depend on a specific logging
framework and has built-in adapters for a variety of logging frameworks.
You can also write a new adapter to integrate with loggers Jet doesn't
natively support. To use one of the built-in adapters, set the
`hazelcast.logging.type` property to one of the following:

* `jdk`: java.util.logging (default)
* `log4j`: Apache Log4j
* `log4j2`: Apache Log4j 2
* `slf4j`: SLF4J
* `none`: Turn off logging

For example, to configure Jet to use Log4j, you can do one of the
following:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/LogDebug.java[tag=s1]
----

or

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/LogDebug.java[tag=s2]
----

For more detailed information about how to configure logging, please
refer to the {hz-refman}#logging-configuration[IMDG reference manual].

== Inspect Output of Individual Stages

While debugging your pipeline you'll want to see the output of an
individual stage. You can achieve it by using the
{jet-javadoc}/GeneralStage.html#peek--[`peek()`] stage. For example:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/LogDebug.java[tag=s3]
----

<1> Logs all the word tokens emitted by the filtering stage

If you run it like this:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/LogDebug.java[tag=s4]
----

this is how your output may look:

The logger name of
`com.hazelcast.jet.impl.processor.PeekWrappedP.filter#1` consists of the
following parts:

* `com.hazelcast.jet.impl.processor.PeekWrappedP`: the type of the
processor writing the log message
* `filter`: the name of the vertex the processor belongs to
* `#0`: index of the processor within the vertex. The index is unique
cluster-wide.

<<inspecting-processor-input-and-output, Best Practices>> section.

[[management-center]]
= Management Center

Hazelcast Jet Management Center is a management and monitoring suite providing
a live overview of the Hazelcast Jet cluster.
Management Center includes a tool for diagnosing data flow within the
running Hazelcast Jet job. It provides a visualization of the computational
stages and allows you to peek into the stats across the data flow graph
enabling you to diagnose bottlenecks.

Please refer to the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet-management-center/latest/manual/[Hazelcast Jet Management Center Reference Manual] for installation and usage instructions.
