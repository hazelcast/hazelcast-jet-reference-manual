= Build Your Computation Pipeline

== The Shape of a Pipeline

The general shape of any data processing pipeline is `drawFromSource ->
transform -> drainToSink` and the natural way to build it is from source
to sink. The {jet-javadoc}/Pipeline.html[Pipeline] API follows this
pattern. For example,

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s1]
----

In each step, such as `drawFrom` or `drainTo`, you create a pipeline
_stage_. The stage resulting from a `drainTo` operation is called a
_sink stage_ and you can't attach more stages to it. All others are
called _compute stages_ and expect you to attach stages to them.

The API differentiates between batch (bounded) and stream (unbounded)
sources and this is reflected in the naming: there is a `BatchStage`
and a `StreamStage`, each offering the operations appropriate to its
kind. In this section we'll mostly use batch stages, for simplicity,
but the API of operations common to both kinds is identical. We'll
explain later on how to apply windowing, which is necessary to aggregate
over unbounded streams.

Your pipeline can consist of multiple sources, each starting its own
branch, and you mix both kinds in the same pipeline. You can merge the
branches with joining transforms. For example, the <<hash-join,
hash-join>> transform can join a stream stage with batch stages:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s2]
----

Symmetrically, you can fork the output of a stage and send it to more
than one destination:

include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s3]

== Choose Your Data Sources and Sinks

Hazelcast Jet has support for these data sources and sinks:

- Hazelcast `IMap` and `ICache`, both as a batch source of just their
contents and their event journal as an infinite source
- Hazelcast `IList` (batch)
- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) (batch)
- Kafka topic (infinite stream)
- TCP socket (infinite stream)
- a directory on the filesystem, both as a batch source of the current
  file contents and an infinite source of append events to the files

You can access most of them via the
{jet-javadoc}/pipeline/Sources.html[`Sources`] and
{jet-javadoc}/pipeline/Sinks.html[`Sinks`] utility classes.
{jet-javadoc}/KafkaSources.html[Kafka] and
{jet-javadoc}/HdfsSources.html[HDFS] connectors are in their separate
modules.

There's a <<source-sink-connectors, dedicated section>> that discusses
the topic of data sources and sinks in more detail.

== Compose the Pipeline Transforms

The simplest kind of transformation is one that can be done on each item
individually and independent of other items. The major examples are
{jet-javadoc}/pipeline/BatchStage.html#map-com.hazelcast.jet.function.DistributedFunction-[`map`],
{jet-javadoc}/pipeline/BatchStage.html#filter-com.hazelcast.jet.function.DistributedPredicate-[`filter`]
and
{jet-javadoc}/pipeline/BatchStage.html#flatMap-com.hazelcast.jet.function.DistributedFunction-[`flatMap`].
We already saw them in use in the previous examples. `map` transforms
each item to another item; `filter` discards items that don't match its
predicate; and `flatMap` transforms each item into zero or more output
items.

Beyond these simple transforms Jet offers the _hash-join_ for data
enrichment and _aggregation_, the most powerful and versatile transform.
We discuss these in the following sections.

[[hash-join]]
== Hash-Join

{jet-javadoc}/pipeline/BatchStage.html#hashJoin-com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.BatchStage-com.hazelcast.jet.pipeline.JoinClause-com.hazelcast.jet.function.DistributedBiFunction-[Hash-join]
is a specialization of a general "`join`" operation, optimized for the use
case of _data enrichment_. In this scenario there is a single,
potentially infinite data stream (the _primary_ stream), that goes
through a mapping transformation which attaches to each item some more
items found by hashtable lookup. The hashtables have been populated
from all the other streams (the _enriching_ streams) before the
consumption of the primary stream started.

For each enriching stream you can specify a pair of key-extracting
functions: one for the enriching item and one for the primary item. This
means that you can define a different join key for each of the enriching
streams. The following example shows a three-way hash-join between the
primary stream of stock trade events and two enriching streams:
_products_ and _brokers_.

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s10]
----

Products are joined on `Trade.productId` and brokers on
`Trade.brokerId`. `joinMapEntries()` returns a `JoinClause`, which is a
holder of the three functions that specify how to perform a join:

1. the key extractor for the primary stream's item
2. the key extractor for the enriching stream's item
3. the projection function that transforms the enriching stream's item
into the item that will be used for enrichment.

Typically the enriching streams will be `Map.Entry` s coming from a
key-value store, but you want just the entry value to appear as the
enriching item. In that case you'll specify `Map.Entry::getValue` as the
projection function. This is what `joinMapEntries()` does for you. It
takes just one function, primary stream's key extractor, and fills in
`Entry::getKey` and `Entry::getValue` for the enriching stream key
extractor and the projection function, respectively.

In the interest of performance the entire enriching dataset resides on
each cluster member. That's why this operation is also known as a
_replicated_ join. This is something to keep in mind when estimating
the RAM requirements for a hash-join operation.

=== Hash-Join With Four or More Streams Using the Builder

You can hash-join a stream with up to two enriching streams using the
API we demonstrated above. If you have more than two enriching streams,
you'll use the
{jet-javadoc}/pipeline/StreamStage.html#hashJoinBuilder--[hash-join builder].
For example, you may want to enrich a trade with its associated product,
broker, and market:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s11]
----

The data type on the hash-joined stage is `Tuple2<Trade, ItemsByTag>`.
The next snippet shows how to use it to access the primary and enriching
items:

include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s12]

== Aggregation and Grouping

Data aggregation is the cornerstone of distributed stream processing. It
computes an aggregate function (simple examples: sum or average) over
the data items. Typically you don't want to agregate all the items
together, but classify them by some key and then aggregate over each
group separately. This is the _group-and-aggregate_ transformation. You
can simultaneously join several streams on a key and group-aggregate
them on the same key. This is the _cogroup-and-aggregate_
transformation. Finally, if you're processing an unbounded event stream,
you must define a bounded _window_ over the stream within which Jet will
aggregate the data.

This is how a very simple batch aggregation without grouping may look
(the list named "`text`" contains lines of text):

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s4]
----

We simply counted all the lines and pushed the count to a list named
"`result`". Let's count all the words instead:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s5]
----

We split up the lines into words using a regular expression. Blank lines
result in empty "`words`" so we filter these out.

Now let's turn this into something more insigtful: a word frequency
histogram, giving us for each distinct word the number of its
occurrences:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s6]
----

We just added a grouping key, in this case it is the word itself
(`Util.wholeItem()` returns the identity function). Now our pipeline
produces not one, but as many distinct result items as there are words
in the text. What we've just built up is the classical Word Count task.

The definition of the aggregate operation hides behind the `counting()`
method call. This is a static method in our
{jet-javadoc}/aggregate/AggregateOperations.html[`AggregateOperations`]
utility class, which provides you with some predefined aggregate
operations. You can also implement your own aggregate operations; please
refer to the section <<implement-your-aggregate-operation,
dedicated to this>>.

[[cogroup]]
== Co-Aggregation

Just as we performed aggregate and group-and-aggregate operations above,
we can perform a co-aggregate and cogroup-and-aggregate of several
stages together. In SQL terms this is analogous to a JOIN coupled with a
GROUP BY. The JOIN condition is constrained to matching on the grouping
key.

Here's a simple example where we do the Word Count from two source
lists:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s7]
----

Note the `counting2()` call, this one isn't included in Jet's library.
It is like `AggregateOperations.counting()`, but for two sources. In
this simple example both sources are treated equally (just increment the
total count), but the point of `AggregateOperation` 's API is that you
can differentiate between them and treat each one differently. Here's
an example definition that applies different weights to the streams,
making the stream-1 words worth ten times more than those in stream-0:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s8]
----

[[cogroup-builder]]
===  Co-aggregate Four or More Streams Using the Builder

If you need to join more than three streams, you'll have to use the
{jet-javadoc}/pipeline/StageWithGroupingAndWindow.html#aggregateBuilder--[builder]
object. For example, your goal may be correlating events coming from
different systems, where all the systems serve the same user base. In an
online store you may have separate streams for product page visits,
adding to shopping cart, payments, and deliveries. You want to correlate
all the events associated with the same user. The example below
calculates statistics per category for each user:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s9]
----

Note the interaction between the co-aggregation building code and the
aggregate operation-building code: the co-aggregation builder gives you
type tags that you then pass to the aggregate operation. This
establishes the connection between the streams contributing to the
co-aggregate transform and the aggregate operation processing them.
Refer to the <<implement-your-aggregate-operation, section on
`AggregateOperation`>> to learn more about it.

== Windowed Aggregation

Let's upgrade our batch Word Count to windowed aggregation over an
endless stream of tweets:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s13]
----

Now we've got a Jet job that does live tracking of words currently
trending in tweets. The sliding window definition tells Jet to aggregate
over the last minute and update its result every second.

We employed the simplest way of dealing with the notion of time: we
ignored the time when the event actually happened and just slapped the
current time on it. Usually the event contains its own timestamp and
Jet must honor it. To achieve that, you pass a function that selects the
timestamp to `addTimestamps()`, but now you must also deal with events
coming out of order. We discussed these concerns <<time-ordering, in the
previous chapter>>.

Here's an example with `Tweet` objects that carry their own timestamp:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s14]
----

In the line `.addTimestamps(TweetWord::timestamp,
TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(5))` we specified two things: how to extract
the timestamp and how much event lag we want to tolerate. We said that
an event's timestamp can be at most five seconds behind the newest event
we already received. This also means that Jet will have to delay
emitting a windowed result until it receives an event that's five
seconds past the window's end, so the latency will typically be five
seconds or more.

Notice how we had to struggle a bit to hold on to the timestamp through
the flatmapping transformation. We needed two classes: `Tweet` and
`TweetWord`. We can avoid this need if we assign timestamps earlier on:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/BuildComputation.java[tag=s15]
----

This will work correctly because Jet keeps the event timestamps
internally and correlates the input item to all the output items in a
`flatMap` transformation, propagating the timestamp value.

You should generally prefer setting timestamps as the first thing in
a pipeline because then the source connector will handle the watermarks
itself. The connector knows more about the structure of its source and
can produce better watermarks, with less latency and less dropped late
events.
