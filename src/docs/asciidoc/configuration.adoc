= Configuration

You can configure Hazelcast Jet either programmatically or
declaratively (XML).

== Programmatic Configuration

Programmatic configuration is the simplest way to configure Jet. You
instantiate a {jet-javadoc}/config/JetConfig.html[`JetConfig`] and set
the desired properties. For example, the following will configure Jet to
use only two threads in its _cooperative multithreading_ pool:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/Configuration.java[tag=s1]
----

== Declarative Configuration

If you don't pass an explicit `JetConfig` object when constructing a Jet
instance, it will perform the following lookup procedure:

1. Read the system property `hazelcast.jet.config`. If it starts with
   `classpath:`, treat it as a classpath resource, otherwise it's a file
   pathname. If it's defined but Jet can't find the file it specifies,
   startup fails.
2. Look for `hazelcast-jet.xml` in the working directory.
3. Look for `hazelcast-jet.xml` in the classpath.
4. Load the default XML configuration packaged in Jet's JAR.

An example configuration looks like the following:

[source,xml]
----
<hazelcast-jet xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/jet-config hazelcast-jet-config-0.6.xsd"
               xmlns="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/jet-config"
               xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
    <instance>
        <!-- number of threads in the cooperative thread pool -->
       <cooperative-thread-count>8</cooperative-thread-count>
        <!-- period between flow control packets in milliseconds -->
       <flow-control-period>100</flow-control-period>
        <!-- directory for temporary files -->
       <temp-dir>/var/tmp/jet</temp-dir>
        <!-- number of backup copies to configure for Hazelcast IMaps used internally in a Jet job -->
       <backup-count>1</backup-count>
    </instance>
    <properties>
       <property name="custom.property">custom property</property>
    </properties>
    <edge-defaults>
        <!-- capacity of the concurrent SPSC queue between each two processors -->
       <queue-size>1024</queue-size>

        <!-- maximum packet size in bytes, only applies to distributed edges -->
       <packet-size-limit>16384</packet-size-limit>

        <!-- receive window size multiplier, only applies to distributed edges -->
       <receive-window-multiplier>3</receive-window-multiplier>
    </edge-defaults>
    <!-- custom properties which can be read within a ProcessorSupplier -->
</hazelcast-jet>
----

The following are the configuration elements for Hazelcast Jet:

* Cooperative Thread Count: number of threads Jet will create in its
_cooperative multithreading_ pool. The default value is
`Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`
* Temp Directory: directory where Jet can create temporary files such
as JAR files submitted by clients. Jet will create a temp directory and
delete it on exit.
* Flow Control Period: Jet uses a flow control mechanism between
cluster members to prevent a slower vertex from getting overflowed with
data from a faster upstream vertex. Each receiver regularly reports to
each sender how much more data it may send over a given DAG edge. This
option sets the duration (in milliseconds) of the interval between
flow-control packets. Its default value is 100ms.
* Backup Count: Sets the number of synchronous backups to configure on
IMaps that Jet needs internally to store job metadata and snapshots. The
maximum allowed value is 6. The default value is 1.
* Edge Defaults: The default values to be used for all edges. See the
section on <<fine-tuning-edges, Tuning Edges>>.

== Configure the Underlying Hazelcast Instance

Each Jet member or client has its underlying Hazelcast member or client.
Please refer to the
{hz-refman}#understanding-configuration[Hazelcast Reference Manual]
for specific configuration options for Hazelcast IMDG.

=== Programmatic

You can configure the underlying Hazelcast IMDG member as follows:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/Configuration.java[tag=s2]
----

Similarly, you can also configure the underlying Hazelcast client:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/Configuration.java[tag=s3]
----

=== Declarative

Hazelcast IMDG can also be configured declaratively. Please refer to the
{hz-refman}#configuring-declaratively[Hazelcast Reference Manual]
for information on how to do this.

== Spring Integration

You can configure and start a Hazelcast Jet instance as a component in
the Spring Application Context. You can use the plain `bean` element
and define individual properties on a `JetConfig` instance, but Jet
provides its own schema-based configuration which will make this much
less verbose.

=== Approach 1: Use the Plain `bean` Element

You can declare Hazelcast Jet objects using the default Spring beans
namespace. Here is an example for a Hazelcast Jet Instance declaration:

[source, xml]
----
<bean id="instance" class="com.hazelcast.jet.Jet" factory-method="newJetInstance">
    <constructor-arg>
        <bean class="com.hazelcast.jet.config.JetConfig">
            <property name="hazelcastConfig">
                <bean class="com.hazelcast.config.Config">
                    <!-- ... -->
                </bean>
            </property>
            <property name="instanceConfig">
                <bean class="com.hazelcast.jet.config.InstanceConfig">
                    <property name="cooperativeThreadCount" value="2"/>
                </bean>
            </property>
            <property name="defaultEdgeConfig">
                <bean class="com.hazelcast.jet.config.EdgeConfig">
                    <property name="queueSize" value="2048"/>
                </bean>
            </property>
            <property name="properties">
                <props>
                    <prop key="foo">bar</prop>
                </props>
            </property>
        </bean>
    </constructor-arg>
</bean>

<bean id="map" factory-bean="instance" factory-method="getMap">
    <constructor-arg value="my-map"/>
</bean>
----

=== Approach 2: Use `jet:instance`

Hazelcast Jet provides its own Spring config schema. Add the namespace
declaration `xmlns:jet=“http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/jet-spring”`
to the `beans` element and then use the *_jet_* namespace prefix.
Make sure you added `hazelcast-jet-spring.jar` to the classpath.

Here's how your namespace and schema instance declarations may look:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:jet="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/jet-spring"
       xmlns:hz="http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd
        http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring
        http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/spring/hazelcast-spring-3.10.xsd
        http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/jet-spring
        http://www.hazelcast.com/schema/jet-spring/hazelcast-jet-spring-0.6.xsd">
        <!-- ... -->
 </beans>
----

==== Configuring the Hazelcast Jet Instance

[source,xml]
----
<jet:instance id="instance">
    <hz:config>
        <hz:spring-aware/>
        <hz:group name="jet"/>
        <hz:network port="5701" port-auto-increment="false">
            <hz:join>
                <hz:multicast enabled="false"/>
                <hz:tcp-ip enabled="true">
                    <hz:member>127.0.0.1:5701</hz:member>
                </hz:tcp-ip>
            </hz:join>
        </hz:network>
        <hz:map name="map" backup-count="3">
        </hz:map>
    </hz:config>
    <jet:instance-config cooperative-thread-Count="2"/>
    <jet:default-edge-config queue-size="2048"/>
    <jet:properties>
        <hz:property name="foo">bar</hz:property>
    </jet:properties>
</jet:instance>
----

==== Configure a Jet Client

[source,xml]
----
<jet:client id="jet-client">
    <jet:group name="jet"/>
    <jet:network>
        <hz:member>127.0.0.1:5701</hz:member>
    </jet:network>
    <jet:spring-aware/>
</jet:client>
----

==== Additional Bean Types Supported by the Jet Namespace

You can obtain the underlying `HazelcastInstance` from the Jet instance
as a bean and use it to obtain these Hazelcast IMDG beans:

 - map
 - list
 - multiMap
 - replicatedmap
 - queue
 - topic
 - set
 - executorService
 - idGenerator
 - atomicLong
 - atomicReference
 - semaphore
 - countDownLatch
 - lock

Here are short examples for each of them:

[source,xml]
----
<jet:hazelcast jet-instance-ref="jet-instance" id="hazelcast-instance"/>

<jet:map instance-ref="jet-instance" name="my-map" id="my-map-bean"/>

<jet:list instance-ref="jet-client" name="my-list" id="my-list-bean"/>

<hz:multiMap id="multiMap" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-multiMap"/>

<hz:replicatedMap id="replicatedMap" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-replicatedMap"/>

<hz:queue id="queue" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-queue"/>

<hz:topic id="topic" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-topic"/>

<hz:set id="set" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-set"/>

<hz:executorService id="executorService" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-executorService"/>

<hz:idGenerator id="idGenerator" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-idGenerator"/>

<hz:atomicLong id="atomicLong" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-atomicLong"/>

<hz:atomicReference id="atomicReference" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-atomicReference"/>

<hz:semaphore id="semaphore" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-semaphore"/>

<hz:countDownLatch id="countDownLatch" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-countDownLatch"/>

<hz:lock id="lock" instance-ref="hazelcast-instance" name="my-lock"/>
----

Hazelcast Jet also supports _lazy-init_, _scope_ and _depends-on_ bean
attributes.

[source,xml]
----
<jet:instance id="instance" lazy-init="true" scope="singleton">
<!-- ... -->
</jet:instance>
<jet:client id="client" scope="prototype" depends-on="instance">
<!-- ... -->
</jet:client>
----

=== Annotation-Based Configuration

Annotation-Based Configuration does not require any XML definition.
Simply create a configuration class annotated with `@Configuration` and
provide a `JetInstance` as a bean by annotating the method with `@Bean`.

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public JetInstance instance() {
        return Jet.newJetInstance();
    }
}
----

=== Enabling SpringAware Objects

Hazelcast IMDG has a special annotation, `@SpringAware`, which
enables you to initialize the object with spring context.

When a job is submitted to the cluster, processors are created
by Hazelcast Jet on each member. By marking your processor with
`@SpringAware`, you make spring context accessible to your
processor which gives you the ability:

 - to apply bean properties
 - to apply factory callbacks such as `ApplicationContextAware`,
   `BeanNameAware`
 - to apply bean post-processing annotations such as
   `InitializingBean`, `@PostConstruct`

You need to configure Hazelcast Jet with `<hz:spring-aware/>`
tag or set `SpringManagedContext` programmatically to enable
spring-aware objects. Code samples for
{jet-samples}/integration/spring/src/main/java/jet/spring/XmlConfigurationWithSchemaSample.java[declarative]
and
{jet-samples}/integration/spring/src/main/java/jet/spring/AnnotationBasedConfigurationSample.java[annotation-based]
configurations are available at our Code Samples repo.

== Configuring TLS (Enterprise only)

It is possible to configure Jet to use TLS for all member to member
and member to client communications. TLS requires the use of Jet
Enterprise version.

Once TLS is enabled on a member, all other members in the same cluster
and all clients connecting to the cluster must also have TLS enabled.

The way TLS is configured is same as how it's done in Hazelcast IMDG
Enterprise. To configure TLS, you need a server certificate and a
matching private key and do the necessary configuration on the member side.

The following is an example configuration snippet for `hazelcast.xml`. The
configuration must be present on all the members.

[source,xml]
----
<network>
    <ssl enabled="true">
        <factory-class-name>com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.BasicSSLContextFactory</factory-class-name>
        <properties>
            <property name="protocol">TLS</property>
            <property name="keyStore">/opt/hazelcast.keystore</property>
            <property name="keyStorePassword">password12345</property>
            <property name="trustStore">/opt/hazelcast.truststore</property>
            <property name="trustStorePassword">password12345</property>
            <property name="keyManagerAlgorithm">SunX509</property>
            <property name="trustManagerAlgorithm">SunX509</property>
            <property name="mutualAuthentication">REQUIRED</property>
        </properties>
    </ssl>
</network>
----

And similarly, a matching snippet must be present on the clients
inside the `hazelcast-client.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
<network>
    <ssl enabled="true">
        <factory-class-name>com.hazelcast.nio.ssl.BasicSSLContextFactory</factory-class-name>
        <properties>
            <property name="protocol">TLS</property>

            <property name="trustStore">/opt/hazelcast-client.truststore</property>
            <property name="trustStorePassword">secret.123456</property>
            <property name="trustStoreType">JKS</property>

            <!-- Following properties are only needed when the mutual authentication is used. -->
            <property name="keyStore">/opt/hazelcast-client.keystore</property>
            <property name="keyStorePassword">keystorePassword123</property>
            <property name="keyStoreType">JKS</property>
            <property name="mutualAuthentication">REQUIRED</property>
        </properties>
    </ssl>
</network>
----

A detailed list of TLS configuration options can be found in the
{hz-refman}#tlsssl[Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual].

=== Mutual Authentication

When a client connects to a node, the node can authenticate the client
by using mutual authentication. In this mode, the client also has to
present a certificate to the member upon connection. This requires
some additional configuration. See the
{hz-refman}#mutual-authentication[Mutual Authentication] section on
the IMDG Reference Manual for further details.

=== OpenSSL Configuration

By default Jet uses the Java implementation of SSL. For better performance,
it is also possible to use Jet with OpenSSL instead. For configuring OpenSSL
please refer to the {hz-refman}#integrating-openssl[Hazelcast IMDG Reference Manual].

=== TLS Impact on Performance

TLS can have some effect on performance when running jobs, as all
node to node communications need to be encrypted. During an aggregation
or another partitioned operation in a job, large amounts of data might
be transferred from one node to another.

Jet makes use of <<concepts,several techniques>> that reduce the need
for data to be transferred across the nodes, however this is sometimes unavoidable.
When using Java SSL, the performance impact can be between 5-30% depending on how
much network is utilized. When using OpenSSL, we measured the impact to be minimal
regardless of the amount of network traffic. Detailed benchmarks are available
upon request.

=== Remote Hazelcast Sources and Sinks

Currently it's not possible to connect to remote Hazelcast sources and sinks
using TLS. This issue will be resolved in a further patch release.
