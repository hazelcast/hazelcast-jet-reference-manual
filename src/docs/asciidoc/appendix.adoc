= Phone Homes

Hazelcast uses phone home data to learn about the usage of Hazelcast Jet.

Hazelcast Jet instances call our phone home server initially when they
are started and then every 24 hours. This applies to all the instances
joined to the cluster.

== What is sent in?

The following information is sent in a phone home:

* Hazelcast Jet version
* Local Hazelcast Jet member UUID
* Download ID
* A hash value of the cluster ID
* Cluster size bands for 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 100, 150, 300, 600 and > 600
* Number of connected clients bands of 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 100, 150, 300, 600 and > 600
* Cluster uptime
* Member uptime
* Environment Information:
** Name of operating system
** Kernel architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
** Version of operating system
** Version of installed Java
** Name of Java Virtual Machine
* Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise specific:
** Number of clients by language (Java, C++, C#)
** Flag for Hazelcast Enterprise
** Hash value of license key
** Native memory usage

== Phone Home Code

The phone home code itself is open source. Please see https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/util/PhoneHome.java[here].

== Disabling Phone Homes

Set the `hazelcast.phone.home.enabled` system property to false either
in the config or on the Java command line.

Starting with Hazelcast Jet 0.5, you can also disable the phone home
using the environment variable `HZ_PHONE_HOME_ENABLED`. Simply add the
following line to your `.bash_profile`:

[source,]
----
export HZ_PHONE_HOME_ENABLED=false
----

== Phone Home URL

The URL used for phone home requests is
[source,]
----
http://phonehome.hazelcast.com/ping

= License Questions

Hazelcast Jet is distributed using the
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[Apache License 2],
therefore permissions are granted to use, reproduce and distribute it
along with any kind of open source and closed source applications.

Depending on the used feature-set, Hazelcast Jet has certain runtime
dependencies which might have different licenses. Following are
dependencies and their respective licenses.

== Embedded Dependencies

Embedded dependencies are merged (shaded) with the Hazelcast Jet
codebase at compile-time. These dependencies become an integral part of
the Hazelcast Jet distribution.

For license files of embedded dependencies, please see the `license`
directory of the Hazelcast Jet distribution, available at our
https://jet.hazelcast.org/download/[download page].

=== minimal-json

minimal-json is a JSON parsing and generation library which is a part of
the Hazelcast Jet distribution. It is used for communication
between the Hazelcast Jet cluster and the Management Center.

minimal-json is distributed under the
http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT[MIT license] and offers the same
rights to add, use, modify, and distribute the source code as the Apache
License 2.0 that Hazelcast uses. However, some other restrictions might
apply.

=== Runtime Dependencies

Depending on the used features, additional dependencies might be added
to the dependency set. Those runtime dependencies might have other
licenses. See the following list of additional runtime dependencies.

=== Apache Hadoop

Hazelcast integrates with Apache Hadoop and can use it as a data
 sink or source. Jet has a dependency on the libraries required to
 read from and write to the Hadoop File System.

Apache Hadoop is distributed under the terms of the
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[Apache License 2].

=== Apache Kafka

Hazelcast integrates with Apache Kafka and can make use of it as a
data sink or source. Hazelcast has a dependency on Kafka client
libraries.

Apache Kafka is distributed under the terms of the
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0[Apache License 2].

=== Spring

Hazelcast integrates with Spring and can be configured using Spring
Context. Jet has a dependency on the libraries required to create a
Spring context.

relationship and differences between Hazelcast Jet and Hazelcast IMDG,
Jet's APIs and roadmap.

[appendix]
= Common Exceptions

You may see the following exceptions thrown when working with Jet:

* {jet-javadoc}/JetException.html[`JetException`]:
A general exception thrown if a job failure occurs. It has the original
exception as its cause.
* {jet-javadoc}/core/TopologyChangedException.html[`TopologyChangedException`]:
Thrown when a member participating in a job leaves the cluster. If
auto-restart is enabled, Jet will restart the job automatically, without
throwing the exception to the user.
* {jet-javadoc}/core/JobNotFoundException.html[`JobNotFoundException`]:
Thrown when the coordinator node is not able to find the metadata for a
given job.

There are also several Hazelcast exceptions that might be thrown when
interacting with `JetInstance`. For a description of Hazelcast IMDG
exceptions, please refer to the
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.9/manual/html-single/index.html#common-exception-types[IMDG Reference manual].
