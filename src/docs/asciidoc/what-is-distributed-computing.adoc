= How Distributed Computing Works in Jet

In this chapter we will take a deep dive into the fundamentals of
distributed computing and Jet's specific take on it. If you want to
start coding with Jet right away, you can move on to the <<work-with-jet,
next chapter>>, but you'll find that having some intuition and insight
into how distributed computing actually works in Jet makes a big
difference when diagnosing your pipeline and improving its performance.

Jet provides high performance in-memory data processing by modeling the
computation as a _Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)_, where vertices
represent computation and edges represent data connections. A vertex
receives data from its inbound edges, performs a step in the
computation, and emits data to its outbound edges. A single vertex's
computation work is performed in parallel by many instances of the
`Processor` type around the cluster.

One of the major reasons to divide the full computation task into
several vertices is _data partitioning_: the ability to split the data
stream into slices which can be processed in parallel, independently of
each other. This is how Jet can parallelize and distribute the
_group-and-aggregate_ stream transformation, the major workhorse in
distributed computing. To make this work, there must be a function which
computes the _partitioning key_ for each item and makes all related
items map to the same key. Jet can then route all such items to the same
processor instance, but has the freedom to route items with different
keys to different processors.

Typically your computation job consists of a _mapping_ vertex, where you
pre-process the input data into a form that's ready to be partitioned,
followed by the grouping-and-aggregating vertex. The edge between them
contains the partitioning logic.

[[word-count-dag-model]]
== Modeling the Computation as a DAG

We'll take one specific problem, the Word Count, dissect it and explain
how it gets computed in a Jet cluster. Let us first see the definition
of the computation in the Pipeline API]:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/WhatIsDistributedComputing.java[tag=s1]
----

Now let's step back from this and start from the single-threaded Java
code that solves the problem for a basic data structure such as an
`ArrayList`. If you have some familiarity with the `java.util.stream`
API, this is how you'd express it:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/WhatIsDistributedComputing.java[tag=s2]
----

You can notice a strong similarity with the Pipeline API formulation,
but the way it's executed is radically different. Java will compute it
in a single thread, basically running this code:

[source]
----
include::{javasource}/WhatIsDistributedComputing.java[tag=s3]
----

The j.u.s. formulation helps us see the steps taken to process each data
item:

1. `lines.stream()`: read the items (lines of text) from the data source
(we'll call this the "`source`" step).
2. `flatMap()`+`filter()`: split each line into lowercase words,
avoiding empty strings (the tokenizing step).
3. `collect()`: group equal words together and count them (the
accumulating step).

Our next move is to express these steps as a DAG. We'll start with a
single-threaded model and then make several transformations to reach a
parallelized, distributed one, discussing at each step the concerns that
arise and how to meet them.

We can represent the steps outlined above in a directed acyclic graph
(DAG):

image::wordcount-dag.png[Word-counting DAG,600,170,align="center"]

The simplest, single-threaded code (shown above) deals with each item as
it is produced: the outer loop reads the lines, the inner loop that runs
for each line deals with the words on that line, and inside the inner
loop we populate the result map with running counts.

However, just by modeling the computation as a DAG, we've split the work
into isolated steps with clear data interfaces between them. We can
perform the same computation by running a separate thread for each step.
Roughly speaking, these are the snippets the threads would be executing:

[source]
// Source thread
for (String line : readLines()) {
    emit(line);
}

[source]
// Tokenizer thread
for (String line : receive()) {
    for (String word : line.toLowerCase().split("\\W+")) {
        if (!word.isEmpty()) {
            emit(word);
        }
    }
}

[source]
// Accumulator thread
Map<String, Long> counts = new HashMap<>();
for (String word : receive()) {
    counts.merge(word, 1L, (count, one) -> count + one);
}
// finally, when done receiving:
for (Entry<String, Long> wordAndCount : counts.entrySet()) {
    emit(wordAndCount);
}

The source loop feeds the tokenizer loop over a concurrent queue, the
tokenizer feeds the accumulator loop, and after the accumulator is done
receiving, it emits its results to the sink. Diagrammatically it looks
like this:

image::wordcount-dag-queue.png[Word-counting DAG with concurrent queues shown,600,170,align="center"]

This transformation brought us a _pipelined_ architecture: while the
tokenizer is busy with the regex work, the accumulator is updating the
map using the data the tokenizer is done with; and the source and sink
stages are pumping the data from/to the environment. Our design is now
able to engage more than one CPU core and will complete that much
sooner; however, we're still limited by the number of vertices. We'll be
able utilize two or three cores regardless of how many are available. To
move forward we must try to parallelize the work of each individual
vertex.

Given that our input is an in-memory list of lines, the bottleneck
occurs in the processing stages (tokenizing and accumulating). Let's
first attack the tokenizing stage: it is a so-called "embarrassingly
parallelizable" task because the processing of each line is completely
self-contained. At this point we have to make a clear distinction
between the notions of _vertex_ and _processor_: there can be several
processors doing the work of a single vertex. Let's add another
tokenizing processor:

image::wordcount-tokenizer.png[Word-counting DAG with tokenizer vertex parallelized,600,170,align="center"]

The input processor can now use all the available tokenizers as a pool
and submit to any one whose queue has some room.

The next step is parallelizing the accumulator vertex, but this is
trickier: accumulators count word occurrences so using them as a pool
will result in each processor observing almost all distinct words
(entries taking space in its hashtable), but the counts will be partial
and will need combining. The common strategy to reduce memory usage is
to ensure that all occurrences of the same word go to the same
processor. This is called "`data partitioning`" and in Jet we'll use a
_partitioned edge_ between the tokenizer and the accumulator:

image::wordcount-partitioned.png[Word-counting DAG with tokenizer and accumulator parallelized,600,170,align="center"]

As a word is emitted from the tokenizer, it goes through a "`switchboard`"
stage where it's routed to the correct downstream processor. To
determine where a word should be routed, we can calculate its hashcode
and use the lowest bit to address either accumulator 0 or accumulator 1.

At this point we have a blueprint for a fully functional parallelized
computation job which can max out all the CPU cores given enough
instances of tokenizing and accumulating processors. The next challenge
is making this work across machines.

For starters, our input can no longer be a simple in-memory list because
that would mean each machine processes the same data. To exploit the
cluster as a unified computation device, each cluster member must
observe only a slice of the dataset. Given that a Jet instance is also a
fully functional Hazelcast IMDG instance and a Jet cluster is also a
Hazelcast IMDG cluster, the natural choice is to pre-load our data into
an `IMap`, which will be automatically partitioned and distributed
across the members. Now each Jet member can just read the slice of data
that was stored locally on it.

When run in a cluster, Jet will instantiate a replica of the whole DAG
on each member. On a two-member cluster there will be two source
processors, four tokenizers, and so on. The trickiest part is the
partitioned edge between tokenizer and accumulator: each accumulator is
supposed to receive its own subset of words. That means that, for
example, a word emitted from tokenizer 0 will have to travel across the
network to reach accumulator 3, if that's the one that happens to own
it. On average we can expect every other word to need network transport,
causing both serious network traffic and serialization/deserialization
CPU load.

There is a simple trick we can employ to avoid most of this traffic,
closely related to what we pointed above as a source of problems when
parallelizing locally: members of the cluster can be used as a pool,
each doing its own partial word counts, and then send their results to a
combining vertex. Note that this means sending only one item per
distinct word. Here's the rough equivalent of the code the combining
vertex executes:

[source]
// Combining vertex
Map<String, Long> combined = new HashMap<>();
for (Entry<String, Long> wordAndCount : receive()) {
    combined.merge(wordAndCount.getKey(), wordAndCount.getValue(),
                    (accCount, newCount) -> accCount + newCount);
}
// finally, when done receiving:
for (Entry<String, Long> wordAndCount : combined.entrySet()) {
    emit(wordAndCount);
}

As noted above, such a scheme takes more memory due to more hashtable
entries on each member, but it saves network traffic (an issue we didn't
have within a member). Given that memory costs scale with the number of
distinct keys (english words in our case), the memory cost is
more-or-less constant regardless of how much book material we process.
On the other hand, network traffic scales with the total data size so
the more material we process, the more we save on network traffic.

Jet distinguishes between _local_ and _distributed_ edges, so we'll use
a _local partitioned_ edge for `tokenize`->`accumulate` and a
_distributed partitioned_ edge for `accumulate`->`combine`. With this
move we've finalized our DAG design, which can be illustrated by the
following diagram:

image::wordcount-distributed.png[Word-counting DAG parallelized and distributed,600,170,align="center"]

[[unbounded-stream-processing]]
== Unbounded Stream Processing

So far we've worked with a bounded (finite) stream processing task.
In general, you provide Jet with one or more pre-existing datasets and
order it to mine them for interesting information. The most important
workhorse in this area is the "join, group and aggregate" operation: you
define a classifying function that computes a grouping key for each of
the datasets and an aggregate operation that will be performed on all
the items in each group, yielding one result item per distinct key. Jet
can apply the same operation on unbounded data streams as well.

=== The Importance of "`Right Now`"

In batch jobs the data we process represents a point-in-time snapshot of
our state of knowledge (for example, warehouse inventory where
individual data items represent items on stock). We can recapitulate
each business day by setting up regular snapshots and batch jobs.
However, there is more value hiding in the freshest data &mdash; our
business can win by reacting to minute-old or even second-old updates.
To get there we must make a shift from the finite to the infinite: from
the snapshot to a continuous influx of events that update our state of
knowledge. For example, an event could pop up in our stream every time
an item is checked in or out of the warehouse.

A single word that captures the above story is _latency_: we want our
system to minimize the latency from observing an event to acting upon
it.

=== Windowing

In an unbounded stream, the dimension of time is always there.  Consider
a batch job: it may process a dataset labeled "`Wednesday`", but the
computation itself doesn't have to know this. Its results will be
understood from the outside to be "`about Wednesday`". An endless stream,
on the other hand, delivers information about the reality as it is
unfolding, in near-real time, and the computation itself must deal with
time explicitly.

Another point: in a batch it is obvious when to stop aggregating and
emit the results: when we have exhausted the whole dataset. However,
with unbounded streams we need a policy on how to select bounded chunks
whose aggregate results we are interested in. This is called
_windowing_. We imagine the window as a time interval laid over the time
axis. A given window contains only the events that belong to that
interval.

A very basic type of window is the _tumbling window_, which can be
imagined to advance by tumbling over each time. There is no overlap
between the successive positions of the window. In other words, it
splits the time-series data into batches delimited by points on the time
axis. The result of this is very similar to running a sequence of batch
jobs, one per time interval.

A more useful and powerful policy is the _sliding window_: instead of
splitting the data at fixed boundaries, it lets it roll in
incrementally, new data gradually displacing the old. The window
(pseudo)continuously slides along the time axis.

Another popular policy is called the _session window_ and it's used to
detect bursts of activity by correlating events bunched together on the
time axis. In an analogy to a user's session with a web application,
the session window "`closes`" when the specified session timeout elapses
with no further events.

[[time-ordering]]
=== Time Ordering and the Watermark

Usually the time of observing an event is explicitly written in a field
of the stream item. There is no guarantee that items will occur in the
stream ordered by the value of that field; in fact in many cases it is
certain that they won't. Consider events gathered from users of a mobile
app: for all kinds of reasons the items will arrive to our datacenter
out of order, even with significant delays due to connectivity issues.

This disorder in the event stream makes it more difficult to formally
specify a rule that tells us at which point all the data for a given
window has been gathered, allowing us to emit the aggregated result.

To approach these challenges we use the concept of the
{jet-javadoc}/core/Watermark.html[_watermark_].
It is a timestamped item Jet inserts into the stream that says "from
this point on there will be no more items with timestamp less than
this". Unfortunately, we almost never know for sure when such a
statement becomes true and there is always a chance some events will
arrive even later. If we do observe such an offending item, we must
categorize it as "`too late`" and just filter it out.

Note the tension in defining the "`perfect`" watermark for a given use
case: it is bad both the more we wait and the less we wait to emit a
given watermark. The more we wait, the higher the latency of getting the
results of the computation; the less we wait, the worse their accuracy
due to missed events.

For these reasons Jet cannot determine the watermark on its own, you
must decide how much disorder to accept (and expect).

== Sliding and Tumbling Window

Many quantities, like "`the current rate of change of a price`" require
you to aggregate your data over some time period. This is what makes the
sliding window so important: it tracks the value of such a quantity in
real time.

Calculating a single sliding window result can be quite computationally
intensive, but we also expect it to slide smoothly and give a new result
often, even many times per second. This is why we gave special attention
to optimizing this computation.

We optimize especially heavily for those aggregate operations that have
a cheap way of combining partial results and even more so for those
which can cheaply undo the combining. For cheap combining you have to
express your operation in terms of a commutative and associative (CA for
short) function; to undo a combine you need the notion of "`negating`" an
argument to the function. A great many operations can be expressed
through CA functions: average, variance, standard deviation and linear
regression are some examples. All of these also support the undoing
(which we call _deduct_). The computation of extreme values (min/max) is
an example that has CA, but no good notion of negation and thus doesn't
support deducting.

This is the way we leverage the above properties: our sliding window
actually "`hops`" in fixed-size steps. The length of the window is an
integer multiple of the step size. Under such a definition, the
_tumbling_ window becomes just a special case with one step per window.

This allows us to divide the timestamp axis into _frames_ of equal
length and assign each event to its frame. Instead of keeping the event
object, we immediately pass it to the aggregate operation's _accumulate_
primitive. To compute a sliding window, we take all the frames covered
by it and combine them. Finally, to compute the next window, we just
_deduct_ the trailing frame and _combine_ the leading frame into the
existing result.

Even without _deduct_ the above process is much cheaper than the most
naïve approach where you'd keep all data and recompute everything from
scratch each time. After accumulating an item just once, the rest of the
process has fixed cost regardless of input size. With _deduct_, the
fixed cost approaches zero.

=== Example: 30-second Window Sliding by 10 Seconds

We'll now illustrate the above story with a specific example: we'll
construct a 30-second window which slides by 10 seconds (i.e., three
steps per window). The aggregate operation is to simply count the number
of events. In the diagrams we label the events as _minutes:seconds_.
This is the outline of the process:

1. Throw each event into its "`bucket`" (the frame whose time interval it
belongs to).
2. Instead of keeping the items in the frame, just keep the item count.
3. Combine the frames into three different positions of the sliding
window, yielding the final result: the number of events that occurred
within the window's timespan.

image::windowing-frames.png[Grouping disordered events by frame and then to sliding window,800,800,align="center"]


This would be a useful interpretation of the results: "At the time 1:30,
the 30-second running average was 8/30 = 0.27 events per second. Over
the next 20 seconds it increased to 10/30 = 0.33 events per second."

Keep in mind that the whole diagram represents what happens on just one
cluster member and for just one grouping key. The same process is going
on simultaneously for all the keys on all the members.

=== Two-stage aggregation

The concept of frame combining helps us implement two-stage aggregation
as well. In the first stage the individual members come up with their
partial results by frame and send them over a distributed edge to the
second stage, which combines the frames with the same timestamp. After
having combined all the partial frames from members, it combines the
results along the event time axis into the sliding window.

image::combining-frames.png[Combining partial frames in two-stage aggregation,800,800,align="center"]

== Session Window

In the abstract sense, the session window is a quite intuitive concept:
it simply captures a burst of events. If no new events occur within the
configured session timeout, the window closes. However, because the Jet
processor encounters events out of their original order, this kind of
window becomes quite tricky to compute.

The way Jet computes the session windows is easiest to explain in terms
of the _event interval_: the range
`[eventTimestamp, eventTimestamp + sessionTimeout]`.
Initially an event causes a new session window to be created, covering
exactly the event interval.

image::session-window-1.png[Session window: single event,250,200,align="center"]


A following event under the same key belongs to this window iff its
interval overlaps it. The window is extended to cover the entire
interval of the new event.

image::session-window-2.png[Session window: extend with another event,150,120,align="center"]

If the event intervals don't overlap, Jet creates new session window for
the new event.

image::session-window-3.png[Session window: create a new window after session timeout,300,110,align="center"]

An event may happen to belong to two existing windows if its interval
bridges the gap between them; in that case they are combined into one.

image::session-window-4.png[Session window: an event may merge two existing windows,300,110,align="center"]


Once the watermark has passed the closing time of a session window, Jet
can close it and emit the result of its aggregation.

== Fault Tolerance and Processing Guarantees

One less-than-obvious consequence of stepping up from finite to infinite
streams is the difficulty of forever maintaining the continuity of the
output, even in the face of changing cluster topology. A Jet node may
leave the cluster due to an internal error, loss of networking, or
deliberate shutdown for maintenance. This will cause the computation job
to be suspended. Except for the obvious problem of new data pouring in
while we're down, we have a much more fiddly issue of restarting the
computation in a differently laid-out cluster exactly where it left off
and neither miss anything nor process it twice. The technical term for
this is the "exactly-once processing guarantee" and, as with all
guarantees, the principle of the weakest link applies: Jet can only
support it up to the level of support from each individual part. The
critical components are the sources and sinks because they are the
boundary between the domain under Jet's control and the environment. A
source must be able to consistently replay data to Jet from a point it
asks for, and the sink must either support transactions or be
_idempotent_, tolerating duplicate submission of data.

As of version 0.6, Hazelcast Jet supports exactly-once processing with
the source being either a Hazelcast `IMap` or a Kafka topic, and the
sink being a Hazelcast `IMap`.

In a Jet cluster, one member is the _coordinator_. It tells other
members what to do and they report to it any status changes. The
coordinator may fail and the cluster will automatically re-elect another
one. If any other member fails, the coordinator restarts the job on the
remaining members.

Job submission is a fire-and-forget action: once a client submits it,
the job has a life of its own independent of the submitter. The
submitter can disconnect and any other client or Jet member can request
a local `Job` instance which allows it to monitor and manage the job.
