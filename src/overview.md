# Overview of Jet

At the core of Jet is the distributed computation engine. It leans onto 
Hazelcast IMDG for cluster forming and maintenance; data partitioning;
and networking. For more information about Hazelcast IMDG, see the 
[latest Hazelcast reference manual](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html).

## Cluster

Jet is meant to be run on several machines forming a cluster, although it 
is also possible to run it on a single node for testing purposes. There 
are several ways to configure the nodes for discovery, explained in detail 
in the [Hazelcast reference manual](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#setting-up-clusters).

## Directed Acyclic Graph

The user describes the computation job in the form of a _directed acyclic 
graph_ (DAG). Each vertex performs a step in the computation and emits 
data items for the vertices it is connected to. A single vertex's
computation work is performed in parallel by many instances of the 
`Processor` type around the cluster. 

One of the major reasons to divide the full computation task into several 
vertices is _data partitioning_: the ability to split the entire dataset 
into slices which can be processed independently of each other. It works 
by defining a function which computes the _partitioning key_ for each item 
and makes all related items map to the same key. The computation engine 
can then route all such items to the same processor instance. This makes 
it easy to parallelize the computation: each processor will have the full 
picture for its slice of the entire data set.

### Edge

As hinted above, the major purpose of the edge is determining how the 
data is routed from individual source processors to individual destination 
processors. The most powerful kind of edge is a _distributed partitioned_ 
one, which guarantees that for each given partitioning key there will be 
only one unique processor in the whole cluster receiving all the items 
with that key. 

With appropriate DAG design, network traffic can be minimized by 
employing _local partitioned_ edges as well. Local edges are implemented 
with the most efficient kind of concurrent queue: single-producer, 
single-consumer bounded queue. It employs wait-free algorithms on both 
sides and avoids `volatile` writes by using `lazySet`.
 
### Processor

A processor's work can be conceptually described as follows: receive data 
from zero or more input streams and emit data into zero or more output 
streams. Each stream maps to a single DAG edge (either inbound or 
outbound). There is no requirement on the correspondence between input 
and output items; a processor can emit any data it sees fit, including 
none at all. This means that it can play the role of a source, sink, or 
transformer of data.

Each vertex can specify how many of its processors will run per cluster 
member; every member will have the same number of processors.


Jet's library provides the `AbstractProcessor` class which simplifies
the implementation of the fully general `Processor` type. A trivial 
implementation might look like this:

```java
public class PlusOneProcessor extends AbstractProcessor {
    @Override
    protected boolean tryProcess(int ordinal, Object item) {
        emit((int)item + 1);
        return true;
    }
}
```

This processor receives `Integer` items and emits each item incremented 
by one. It doesn't differentiate between input streams (treats data from 
all streams the same way) and emits each item to all output streams 
assigned to it.

Processors can be stateful and don't need to be thread-safe. A single 
instance will be called by a single thread at a time, although not 
necessarily always the same thread.

## Cooperative multithreading

Cooperative multithreading is one of the core features of Jet and can be 
roughly compared to [green threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_threads).
It is purely a library-level feature and doesn't involve any low-level
system or JVM tricks; the `Processor` API is simply designed in such a
way that the processor can do a small amount of work each time it is 
invoked, then yield back to the Jet engine. The engine manages a thread 
pool of fixed size (the default is the number reported by 
`Runtime.availableProcessors`) and on each thread the processors 
take their turn in a round-robin fashion. To maintain good overall 
throughput, each processor must take care not to hog the thread for too 
long (rule of thumb is up to a millisecond at a time).

The point of cooperative multithreading is much lower context-switching
cost and precise knowledge of the status of a processor's input and 
output buffers, which determines its ability to make progress.

#### Non-cooperative Processors

For some parts of a Jet job, blocking or otherwise long-running 
operations cannot be avoided. Typically this happens on sources and sinks
because they interact with the environment over I/O channels which 
don't offer non-blocking APIs. A blocking operation is very likely to 
violate the requirements on cooperative processors. To accommodate these 
special cases, Jet allows a processor to declare itself "non-cooperative" 
and get its own Java thread.
