Hazelcast uses phone home data to learn about the usage of Hazelcast Jet.

Hazelcast Jet instances call our phone home server initially when they
are started and then every 24 hours. This applies to all the instances
joined to the cluster.

**What is sent in?**

The following information is sent in a phone home:

- Hazelcast Jet version
- Local Hazelcast Jet member UUID
- Download ID
- A hash value of the cluster ID
- Cluster size bands for 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 100, 150, 300, 600 and > 600
- Number of connected clients bands of 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 100, 150, 300, 600 and > 600
- Cluster uptime
- Member uptime
- Environment Information:
	- Name of operating system
	- Kernel architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
	- Version of operating system
	- Version of installed Java
	- Name of Java Virtual Machine
- Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise specific:
	- Number of clients by language (Java, C++, C#)
	- Flag for Hazelcast Enterprise
	- Hash value of license key
	- Native memory usage

**Phone Home Code**

The phone home code itself is open source. Please see <a

**Disabling Phone Homes**

Set the `hazelcast.phone.home.enabled` system property to false either
in the config or on the Java command line.

Starting with Hazelcast Jet 0.5, you can also disable the phone home
using the environment variable `HZ_PHONE_HOME_ENABLED`. Simply add the
following line to your `.bash_profile`:

```
export HZ_PHONE_HOME_ENABLED=false
```

**Phone Home URL**

The URL used for phone home requests is
<a href="http://phonehome.hazelcast.com/ping"
target="_blank">http://phonehome.hazelcast.com/ping</a>.
