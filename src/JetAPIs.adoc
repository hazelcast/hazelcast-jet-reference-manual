Hazelcast Jet defines several kinds of API, each of which can be used to
build computation jobs. However, there are significant differences
between them.

[Pipeline API](/Work_with_Jet/Build_Your_Computation_Pipeline) is the
one you should use unless you have a specific reason to look at others. 
It is "the Jet API". Powerful and expressive, yet quite simple to grasp
and become  productive in. 

A secondary choice is Jet's implementation of the
[java.util.stream API](/Distributed_Implementation_of_java.util.stream_API),
which some users already familiar with the JDK implementation may find
appealing. However, it is less expressive and also suffers from a
paradigm mismatch: its contract forces us to deliver the job's result in 
the return value, which is a cumbersome way to interact with a 
distributed computation system. The return value's scope is restricted to 
the scope of the Java variable that holds it, but the actual results 
remain in the Jet cluster, leading to possible memory leaks if not 
handled with care.

The most fundamental API is the Core API. All the other APIs are
different front ends to it. It establishes strong low-level abstractions
that expose all the mechanics of Jet's computation. While it can
definitely be used to build a Jet job "from scratch", it is quite
unwieldy to do so because for many aspects there is only one right way
to set them up and many wrong ones.

This chart summarizes the main differences between the APIs.

*: Any source can be used with j.u.stream, but only `IMap` and `IList`
sinks are supported.<br/>
**: `j.u.stream` only supports grouping on one input, co-grouping is not
supported. Furthermore, aggregation is a terminal operation and
additional transforms can't be applied to aggregation results.<br/>
***: Windowing support will be added in 0.6.
