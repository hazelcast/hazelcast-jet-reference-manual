This chapter explains how to start using Hazelcast Jet. It also
describes the executable files in the downloaded distribution package.

## Requirements

Hazelcast Jet requires a minimum JDK version of 8.

## Using Maven and Gradle

The easiest way to start using Hazelcast Jet is to add it as a
dependency to your project.


You can find Hazelcast Jet in Maven repositories. Add the following
lines to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast.jet</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-jet</artifactId>
    <version>0.3</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

If you prefer to use Gradle, execute the following command:

```groovy
compile 'com.hazelcast.jet:hazelcast-jet:0.3'
```

## Downloading

Alternatively, you can download the latest [distribution package for
Hazelcast Jet](http://jet.hazelcast.org/download/)
and add the `hazelcast-jet-<version>.jar` file to your classpath.

### Distribution Package

The distribution package contains the following scripts to help you get
started with Hazelcast Jet:

* `bin/start-jet.sh` and `bin/start-jet.bat` start a new Jet member in the
current directory.
* `bin/stop-jet.sh` and `bin/stop-jet.bat` stop the member started in the
current directory.
* `bin/submit-jet.sh` and `bin/submit-jet.bat` submit a Jet computation job
that was packaged in a self-contained JAR file.
* `bin/cluster.sh` provides basic functionality for Hazelcast cluster
manager, such as changing the cluster state, shutting down the cluster
or forcing the cluster to clean its persisted data.

scripts lets you start one Jet member per folder. To start a new
instance, please unzip the package in a new folder.*
