As mentioned in the
[Work_with_Jet](/Work_with_Jet/Infinite_Stream_Processing#page_Time+Ordering+and+the+Watermark)
chapter, determining the watermark is somewhat of a black art; it's
about superimposing order over a disordered stream of events. We must
decide at which point it stops making sense to wait even longer for data
about past events to arrive. There's a tension between two opposing
forces here:

- wait as long as possible to account for all the data;
- get results as soon as possible.

While there are ways to (kind of) achieve both, there's a significant
associated cost in terms of complexity and overall performance. Hazelcast
Jet takes a simple approach and strictly triages stream items into
"still on time" and "late", discarding the latter.

[`WatermarkPolicy`](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/latest-dev/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/WatermarkPolicy.html)
is the abstraction that computes the value of the watermark for a
(sub)stream of disordered data items. It takes as input the timestamp of
each observed item and outputs the current watermark value.

### Predefined watermark policies

We provide some general, data-agnostic watermark policies in the
[`WatermarkPolicies`](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/latest-dev/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/WatermarkPolicies.html)
class. They vary in how well they deal with advancing the watermark during
a stream lull. The better they deal with it, the more assumptions they
must make on the nature of the events' timestamp values and on the
relationship between the timestamps and the locally observed wall-clock
time.

#### "With Fixed Lag"

The
[`withFixedLag()`](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/latest-dev/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/WatermarkPolicies.html#withFixedLag-long-)
policy will maintain a watermark that lags behind the highest observed
event timestamp by a configured amount. In other words, each time an event
with the highest timestamp so far is encountered, this policy advances the
watermark to `eventTimestamp - lag`. This puts a limit on the spread
between timestamps in the stream: all events whose timestamp is more than
the configured `lag` behind the highest timestamp are considered late.


#### "Limiting Lag and Delay"

The
[`limitingLagAndDelay()`](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/latest-dev/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/WatermarkPolicies.html#limitingLagAndDelay-long-long-)
policy applies the same fixed-lag logic as above and adds another limit:
maximum delay from observing an item and advancing the watermark to at
least that item's timestamp. A stream may experience a lull (no items
arriving) and this added limit will ensure that the watermark doesn't stay
behind the highest timestamp observed before the onset of the lull.
However, the skew between substreams may still cause the watermark that
reaches the downstream vertex to stay behind some timestamps. This is
because the downstream will only get the lowest of all substream
watermarks.

The advantage of this policy is that it doesn't assume anything about
the unit of measurement used for event timestamps.

#### "Limiting Lag and Lull"

The
[`limitingLagAndLull()`](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/latest-dev/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/WatermarkPolicies.html#limitingLagAndLull-long-long-)
policy is similar to `limitingLagAndDelay` in addressing the stream lull
problem and goes a step further by addressing the issues of lull combined
with skew. To achieve this it must introduce an assumption, though: that
the time unit used for event timestamps is milliseconds. After a given
period passes with the watermark not being advanced by the arriving data
(i.e., a lull happens), it will start advancing it in lockstep with the
passage of the local system time. The watermark isn't adjusted _towards_
the local time; the policy just ensures the difference between local time
and the watermark stays the same during a lull. Since the system time
advances equally on all substream processors, the watermark propagated to
downstream is now guaranteed to advance regardless of the lull.

There is, however, a subtle issue with `limitingLagAndLull()`: if there
is any substream that never observes an item, that substream's policy
instance won't be able to initialize its "last seen timestamp" and will
cause the watermark sent to the downstream to forever lag behind all
the actual data.

#### "Limiting Timestamp and Wall-Clock Lag"

The
[`limitingTimestampAndWallClockLag()`](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/latest-dev/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/WatermarkPolicies.html#limitingTimestampAndWallClockLag-long-long-)
policy makes a stronger assumption: that the event timestamps are in
milliseconds since the Unix epoch and that they are synchronized with the
local time on the processing machine. It puts a limit on how much the
watermark can lag behind the local time. As long as its assumption holds,
this policy gives straightforward results. It also doesn't suffer from the
subtle issue with `limitingLagAndLull()`.

### Watermark Throttling

The policy objects presented above will return the "ideal" watermark
value according to their logic; however it would be too much overhead to
insert a watermark item each time the ideal watermark advances
(typically a thousand times per second).
[`WatermarkEmissionPolicy`](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/latest-dev/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/WatermarkEmissionPolicy.html)
is the object that decides whether to emit a watermark item given the last
emitted and the current value of the watermark. For the purpose of
sliding windows there is an easy answer: suppress all watermark items
that belong to the same frame as the already emitted one. Such items
would have no effect since the watermark must advance beyond a frame's
end for the aggregating vertex to consider the frame completed and act
upon its results. The method
[`emitByFrame()`](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/latest-dev/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/WatermarkEmissionPolicy.html#emitByFrame-com.hazelcast.jet.core.WindowDefinition-)
will return a policy with this kind of throttling applied. For other cases
there is
[`emitByMinStep()`](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/latest-dev/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/core/WatermarkEmissionPolicy.html#emitByMinStep-long-)
which suppresses watermark items until the watermark has advanced at least
`minStep` ahead of the previously emitted one.

### Maximum watermark retention on substream merge

When two input streams are merged into one for downstream processing, 
Jet waits for the watermark to advance in all substreams in order to 
advance the overall watermark. The process that does this is called 
_watermark coalescing_ and it results in increased latency of the output 
with respect to the input and possibly also increased memory usage due 
to the retention of all the pending data.

The skew between two distributed streams is defined as the difference in 
their watermark values. There is always some skew in the system and it's 
acceptable, but it can grow very large due to various causes such as a 
hiccup on one of the cluster members (a long GC pause, for example), 
external source hiccup, non-balanced partitions and so on.

An option to limit the watermark retention is available using 
[`JobConfig.setMaxWatermarkRetainMillis()
`](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/jet/latest-dev/javadoc/com/hazelcast/jet/config/JobConfig.html#setMaxWatermarkRetainMillis-int-).
The option sets the maximum time to retain the watermarks while 
coalescing them. A negative value disables the limit and Jet will retain 
the watermark as long as needed. With this setting you choose a 
trade-off between latency and correctness that arises when dealing with 
stream skew.
