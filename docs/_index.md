Welcome to the Hazelcast Jet Reference Manual. This manual includes
concepts, instructions, and samples to guide you on how to use Hazelcast
Jet to build applications.

Hazelcast Jet is a distributed computing platform for fast processing of
big data sets. With Hazelcast In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) providing
storage functionality, Hazelcast Jet performs parallel execution
enabling data-intensive applications to operate in real-time. Using
directed acyclic graphs (DAG) to model relationships between individual
steps in the data processing pipeline, Hazelcast Jet is simple to deploy
and can execute both stream and batch-based data processing applications
simultaneously because it is continuously operating. Hazelcast Jet is an
Apache 2 licensed open source project. Please also refer to
[Hazelcast Jet website](http://jet.hazelcast.org/) for information on
its features, use cases and performance considerations.

As the reader of this manual, you must be familiar with the Java
programming language and you should have installed your preferred
Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
