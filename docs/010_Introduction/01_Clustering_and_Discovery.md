Hazelcast Jet typically runs on several machines that form a cluster but
it may also run on a single JVM for testing purposes.
There are several ways to configure the members for discovery, explained
in detail in the [Hazelcast IMDG Reference
Manual](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#setting-up-clusters).
